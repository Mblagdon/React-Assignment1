# React-Assignment1
This is the first assignment for my CP3540 class, where we will be learning to use react.
The assignment is as follows:

Assignment #1 (15 marks) ( 5% of final mark)
Due Friday Sept 22nd
For this assignment we are going to focus on the functionality of the react front end. You must use
github and git. I need to see a consistent record of commits so that I can see how you developed your
project. (For example, having one large commit where all the work is basically done is not acceptable)
As we are focusing on just react, there is no requirement to add styles to your assignment. There is a
bonus section to use a css framework. You may only do the bonus if you have all the other
requirements complete.
Requirements:
Starting with the Create-React-App template build a simple React front end to show cooking recipes.
(The basics) /10
1. There will be 2 pages with links in a top navigation bar component. The first page displays all the
recipes and the second is a page with a form to submit new recipes. Use React-Router to handle moving
between the two pages.
2. Each recipe should contain the following information:
-Name
-Ingredients
-Directions
-Description
-Image of prepared recipe
3. Your front end will load information regarding several recipes from a .json data file.
4. Once loaded, you will use React Components to display all of the recipes.
(Stepping it up) /5
5. For each recipe, add a “Remove” button. This button when pressed will remove the display of the
recipe. ( See pg 222 to 257 in book )
6. Add a form where the user can enter information for a recipe. The form when submitted will add the
recipe data to the front end and this new recipe will be displayed. (See pg 257 to 271 in book)
For the image to be displayed, use a select element on the form to choose a placeholder or a specific
image for the recipe you want to use
(Bonus) /2 (May only attempt if completed all previous requirements)
Use react-bootstrap for css layout and styling
